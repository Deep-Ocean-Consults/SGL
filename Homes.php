				With the growing population in Nigeria, the real estate sector continues to be one of the most advanced sectors within the economy, the role of the sector to the economic growth of a nation is greatly overlooked in developing countries and as such there are a lot of missed opportunities and unlocked market potential in the market. However, within the real estate market today, there seems to be a wealth of information not properly disseminated across relevant parties, stakeholders and the demand market. <br> <br>

				As the world continues to advance and become technology savvy, the need for an online platform to guide clients and help them navigate the wealth of data and information available within the real estate sector is paramount. <br> <br>

				SGL28.COM focuses on our platform being used as an intermediary between buyers, sellers and developers, this is done by providing transparency into the real estate sector and matching consumer needs to available resources. <br> <br>

				The platform does not only possess relevant information on available resources but also translate the information into useful perceptions for buyers, sellers and developers accordingly. <br> <br>
